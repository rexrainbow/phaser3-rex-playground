story-en: |
  The afternoon sun filtered softly through the blinds, casting warm streaks of light across the quiet office.
  She had been absorbed in her papers when a sudden warmth brushed against her neck. His lips followed a breath of heat, sending a shiver down her spine like a spark igniting through her veins.

  "What are you doing… this is the office…"
  Her voice trembled, the words meant as protest but sounding more like a plea.

  He gave no answer, only a faint, knowing smile as his fingers moved with practiced ease, slipping open the top button of her blouse. Cool air touched her skin at the same moment as the heat of his hand, and color rushed to her cheeks.

  She tried to resist, her hand pressing lightly against his, but she couldn't bring herself to push him away. His voice, low and husky, grazed her ear: "Don't worry. No one will come in.""

  His kisses deepened, tracing a slow path along the sensitive curve of her neck. Each brush of his lips sent a wave of heat through her, leaving her breath shallow and uneven. She bit her lower lip, desperate to steady herself, yet her body betrayed her, trembling with a mixture of tension and desire.

  Her blouse fell open just enough to reveal a glimpse of pale, glowing skin under the sunlight. His hand lingered near the edge of the fabric, never quite crossing the boundary, and that restraint made her heart race even faster. The danger—that he could go further at any moment—was almost more intoxicating than if he actually had.

  "Stop… someone might see…"
  Her voice quivered, yet the words lacked conviction.

  He didn't answer. Instead, his lips found her ear, teeth grazing her earlobe in a teasing bite. The sudden shock made her knees weaken, and she gripped the edge of the desk to steady herself.

  Outside, the city roared with life, but here, the world had shrunk to the sound of their quickened breaths and the warmth of their closeness. Reason urged her to push him away, yet her body leaned helplessly into the dangerous intimacy, surrendering to the heat that filled the small office.

  In that fragile moment, she realized escape was no longer an option.

  午後的陽光透過百葉窗縫隙灑落，為辦公室鍍上一層暖意。
  她原本專注在文件上，卻在頸邊忽然感覺到一股灼熱的氣息。男人的唇輕輕貼上她的肌膚，帶來一陣電流般的顫慄。

  「你在做什麼……這裡是辦公室……」
  她低聲抗議，卻連自己都聽得出語氣中的顫抖與無力。

  男人沒有回答，只是微微笑了笑，指尖順勢解開了她襯衫的上方扣子。那一瞬間，冰涼的空氣與他掌心的溫度同時落在她的胸前，讓她臉頰瞬間染紅。

  她下意識地伸手想阻止，卻只是輕輕按住了他的手，無法真正推開。耳邊傳來低沉而帶著熱意的聲音：「放心，不會有人進來。」

  他吻得更深，唇舌沿著她敏感的頸側游移，每一下都挑動著她的神經。她咬著下唇，努力壓抑胸口洶湧的心跳，卻怎麼也控制不住因緊張與渴望而顫抖的呼吸。

  襯衫微微敞開，露出的雪白肌膚在陽光下格外耀眼。男人的手沒有進一步冒犯，卻停留在布料邊緣，溫熱的觸感令她渾身僵硬。那種「隨時可能越界」的危險感，比真正的放縱還要令人心慌。

  「不要……真的會被發現……」
  她的聲音顫抖，卻缺乏真正的拒絕。

  男人沒有再多說話，只是輕輕咬了咬她的耳垂。瞬間，她整個人差點站立不穩，只能死死抓住桌沿。

  外頭車水馬龍，與這個小小空間形成鮮明對比。世界似乎只剩下兩人急促的呼吸與貼合的身影。她的理智還在告訴自己應該推開他，但身體卻誠實地沉浸在這份炙熱曖昧的氛圍中。

  在那一刻，她明白自己已經沒有辦法輕易抽身。
