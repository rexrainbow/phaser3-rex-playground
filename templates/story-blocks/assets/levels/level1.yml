  The sky burned with orange and gold, clouds swelling like waves under the evening sun. The rooftop breeze was gentle, almost tender. He stood near the door, eyes fixed on her figure by the railing.

  She stood there, her school uniform hugging her form in the wind, her long hair drifting freely. She looked like she belonged to the sunset itself—part of the sky, part of the moment. She wasn't smiling, nor speaking, just staring out at the horizon as if waiting… or letting him watch her.

  He took a few steps closer, hesitating. The space between them wasn't far, but it held a kind of weight. Not quite lovers yet, but something undeniably close. The rooftop after school used to be a hidden corner for escaping the crowd. Now, it was a quiet battlefield between feelings not yet spoken.

  "What are you doing up here?” he asked softly.

  She turned to him, her eyes reflecting the fading light. “Watching the clouds. You came too, didn't you?"

  Her words felt like an invitation—and a challenge. As if saying nothing, yet everything. He knew this kind of silence was dangerous. One more step, one more word, and everything between them might begin to change.

  But he didn't move. He simply stood beside her, watching the sky. And in that quiet pause, he knew this sunset—and the way her face looked in it—would stay with him forever.

  傍晚的天空染成了火紅與金橘，雲朵在夕陽下翻騰如浪，校園頂樓的風格外溫柔。男生站在出口不遠處，看著欄杆邊的她。

  她站在那裡，制服被晚風輕拂得貼在身上，長髮隨風飛舞，整個人像是嵌進這幅黃昏畫布裡。沒有笑，也沒有話，只是靜靜望著遠方的天空，像是在等什麼，也像是故意讓他看著。

  他忍不住走近幾步，卻又不敢太靠近。他知道他們之間仍有些距離，不遠，但足以讓心跳失去節奏。放學後的屋頂，曾經是大家避風的秘密基地，現在卻成了兩人之間最微妙的場域。

  「妳怎麼上來了？」他問得很輕。

  她轉頭，眼神還帶著暮色的光影，「想看看今天的雲啊，你不是也來了嗎？」

  一句話，彷彿拉近了他們的距離。她像在暗示什麼，又像沒說什麼。他明白，這種安靜的時刻，才是最危險的。因為只要他再多說一句話、再走近一點，他們之間的那層關係，也許就會開始改變。

  但他還是沒有動，只是站在她身側，與她一起望著天空，在那個沉默的瞬間，他知道——他會一直記得這片晚霞與她的側臉。
