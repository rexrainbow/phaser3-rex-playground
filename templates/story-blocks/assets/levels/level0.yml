title-en: After school

title-zh: 放學後

story-en: |
  The classroom was quiet after school, bathed in the warm slant of the afternoon sun. Light filtered through the tall windows, casting long shadows across the empty desks. The scent of chalk dust lingered in the air, mixed with something softer—maybe her perfume, or just the feeling she always left behind.

  He sat in the back row, textbook open in front of him but long forgotten. His eyes weren’t on the pages. They were on her.

  She was sitting near the front, facing him. Her uniform was slightly rumpled, the ribbon at her collar a little off-center. Her legs, bare beneath her short skirt, caught the sunlight with a soft sheen—had she put on lotion before class ended? She looked straight at him, winked, and stuck out her tongue in that teasing way of hers, one finger playfully tapping the corner of her eye. Mischievous, a little bold. Like always.

  He smiled without meaning to. It wasn’t the first time she’d looked at him like that. And it definitely wouldn’t be the last. They weren’t lovers—at least, not yet. No one had said anything aloud. But they both knew. The space between them hummed with something unspoken, just shy of crossing the line.

  They often stayed after school, making excuses—study sessions, club work, cleaning duty. It didn’t matter what the reason was. What mattered was being near her. What mattered was this quiet, stolen time.

  Suddenly, she stood and walked toward him, hiding her hands behind her back. She leaned forward just slightly, close enough for her voice to be a whisper.

  "Wanna walk home together again today?"

  He nodded, closing his book, heart beating louder than any test could ever make it.

  放學後的教室，陽光從窗戶斜斜灑進來，桌椅映出細長的影子，空氣中仍殘留著粉筆灰與午後陽光混合的氣味。他坐在最後一排的位置，手中握著那本只翻了幾頁的參考書，但目光早已離題，落在教室中央的那個身影上。

  她坐在靠近講台的位置，正對著他。制服的領結略微歪斜，短裙下的腿閃著細膩的光澤——是她剛剛偷偷擦上了護膚油嗎？她朝他眨了眨眼，舌頭俏皮地伸出，指尖點著眼角，一副做了壞事的神情，卻又像在邀請他一起犯規。

  他忍不住笑了一下，那不是第一次，也絕對不會是最後一次。這樣的她，總是能在不經意間撩動他心底最柔軟的那一塊。說是戀人還太早，畢竟誰都沒有說破那層曖昧的窗戶紙。但他知道，她明白——就像他也明白一樣。

  兩人總是在放學後留下，理由千奇百怪：複習、社團、公文打掃……但實際上誰也沒真在意任務是否完成。他只是想多看她幾眼，她也樂得與他單獨相處。

  她突然站起身來，輕輕靠近他的座位，手背藏在身後，彎下腰，小聲問：

  「今天，也要一起走嗎？」

  他輕點頭，合上書本的同時，心跳得比任何考試都還要快。
