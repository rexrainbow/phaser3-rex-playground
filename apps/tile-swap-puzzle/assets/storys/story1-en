The sky burned with orange and gold, clouds swelling like waves under the evening sun. The rooftop breeze was gentle, almost tender. He stood near the door, eyes fixed on her figure by the railing.

She stood there, her school uniform hugging her form in the wind, her long hair drifting freely. She looked like she belonged to the sunset itself—part of the sky, part of the moment. She wasn't smiling, nor speaking, just staring out at the horizon as if waiting… or letting him watch her.

He took a few steps closer, hesitating. The space between them wasn't far, but it held a kind of weight. Not quite lovers yet, but something undeniably close. The rooftop after school used to be a hidden corner for escaping the crowd. Now, it was a quiet battlefield between feelings not yet spoken.

"What are you doing up here?” he asked softly.

She turned to him, her eyes reflecting the fading light. “Watching the clouds. You came too, didn't you?"

Her words felt like an invitation—and a challenge. As if saying nothing, yet everything. He knew this kind of silence was dangerous. One more step, one more word, and everything between them might begin to change.

But he didn't move. He simply stood beside her, watching the sky. And in that quiet pause, he knew this sunset—and the way her face looked in it—would stay with him forever.
