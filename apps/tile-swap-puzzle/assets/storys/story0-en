The classroom was quiet after school, bathed in the warm slant of the afternoon sun. Light filtered through the tall windows, casting long shadows across the empty desks. The scent of chalk dust lingered in the air, mixed with something softer—maybe her perfume, or just the feeling she always left behind.

He sat in the back row, textbook open in front of him but long forgotten. His eyes weren’t on the pages. They were on her.

She was sitting near the front, facing him. Her uniform was slightly rumpled, the ribbon at her collar a little off-center. Her legs, bare beneath her short skirt, caught the sunlight with a soft sheen—had she put on lotion before class ended? She looked straight at him, winked, and stuck out her tongue in that teasing way of hers, one finger playfully tapping the corner of her eye. Mischievous, a little bold. Like always.

He smiled without meaning to. It wasn’t the first time she’d looked at him like that. And it definitely wouldn’t be the last. They weren’t lovers—at least, not yet. No one had said anything aloud. But they both knew. The space between them hummed with something unspoken, just shy of crossing the line.

They often stayed after school, making excuses—study sessions, club work, cleaning duty. It didn’t matter what the reason was. What mattered was being near her. What mattered was this quiet, stolen time.

Suddenly, she stood and walked toward him, hiding her hands behind her back. She leaned forward just slightly, close enough for her voice to be a whisper.

"Wanna walk home together again today?"

He nodded, closing his book, heart beating louder than any test could ever make it.
